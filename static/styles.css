/* * styles.css: Compiled Tailwind CSS Placeholder

In a real development environment, you would generate this file

by compiling your Tailwind configuration:

npx tailwindcss -i ./input.css -o ./static/styles.css --minify

For demonstration and initial setup, we will use the @tailwind directives

here. Note that to fully utilize Tailwind, you need a build step,

but the core CSS will be included via the templates.
